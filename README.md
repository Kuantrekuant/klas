# Project 2 System Administration

This Project was my second project in line with my Bachelor, Applied Information Technology, at HoGent. This project was a very good way of exploring the different ways system administration can go. In general a very good experience with this project and my colleagues. You can find all the relevant information in the different assignment folders.
- Assignment 1: Setting up different Cisco labs (basic)
- Assignment 2: Automated server set-up (LAMP, WISA and SAP Netweaver developer environment)
- Assignment 3: Network infrastructure analysis of an office (Logical and physical)
- Assignment 4: Microsoft Deployment Toolkit in a Microsoft client environment
