# Test report assignment 1: [title]

A test report is the report of the effectuation of the test plan by a team member - someone other than the author of the test plan! It notes for each step in the test plan whether the obtained result matches the expected outcome. If not, it is important to specify in detail what went wrong, what the effective result was, which error messages were generated, etc... The tester should immediately create a Github issue and refer to it from the test report. When the problem is solved, a new test is carried out with a new report.]
