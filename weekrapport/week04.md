## Feedback technisch luik

Both a tender, indicating who is supposed to do what, and a week report for week04 are missing for this task. Difficult to keep track of the progress like this ... 

Documentation on how the basic VMs have been set up would have been expected.

Some remarks on the work done:
Assignment 2.doc: to be avoided. Use markdown
lamp.sh: please add some comment in you script. "-- ... " will give an error
vagrant: good start, but the vagrant script doing the actual work is the next challenge
