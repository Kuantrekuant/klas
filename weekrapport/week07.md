### General

The LAMP & WISA have been met, although better documentation is worth your attention.
SAP is in an initial phase.

Week reports should be prepared in time. It happened in week 4, now it happend again. Once to many.

#### LAMP
Already finished last week, no further remarks. Small improvements have been made.
Also Digital Ocean LAMP has been demonstrated last week.
Creating usefull names for documentation would be a further improvement.

#### WISA
Operational side is working. The server is operational (althought following the test plan was not completed).
Documentation: more structure in the documentation is expected. Keeping track of drafts is allowed, but the final documents should be visible in the GIThub repository, and properly finished.

#### SAP
First steps for a manual install have been taken & document.
This is still work in progress ...
