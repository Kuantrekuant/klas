## Can you specify your current issues and problems?

* We are experimenting some problems with the installation of the Vagrant box in order to make the Vagrant WISA run with the VM.
* We are having problems to know from which point SAP intallation is required to be authomated 
* We are bot sure about how to show that the SAP Netweaver developement environment is working. Is it prossible to run it with SAP GUI?


## Feedback technisch luik

LAMP testing document: improvements expected (minor details): 
- split up "internal set-up procedure" and testing
- dos2unix should be automatically installed.
- test-file should not be manually adapted in the process 

WISA: installing Visual Basic just for testing is not the biggest priority now

SAP: further automatisation is the next step.
