## Feedback technisch luik

Good progress in the LAMP part, only a proper test document is needed.
Full testing should include e.g. connecting from a browser on the host system.

WISA: linking the SQL server to the ASP.net is the more tricky part. 
Hint: try to search for tutorials using PowerShell, as you then immediately have hints towards automatisation.

### Algemeen

### Thor Nicolaï 
### Tommy Veevaete
Your knowledge in the field is quite impressing. Try to use it to support your fellow team members in their learning curves.
