# Assignment 1: network equipment

## Assignment description

As an ICT service provider, we will standardise certain aspects of our service offer on one specific brand. This allows our employees to specialise in the operation of the equipment to a high degree and thus to offer a better service to customers. For network equipment, the choice in the context of this project is obvious: Cisco is one of the main brands.

Familiarise yourself with the equipment, so you can use it later in more complex situations. The starting point will be some simple test setups with routers and switches. Before you start building real set-ups, we ask you to first create the PacketTracer exercise that repeats the commands related to the basic configuration of a switch from Computer Networks 1. This exercise and the labs with regard to the simple test setups can be found in attachment.

- `opdracht-01-Packettracer - basisconfiguratie Switch.pka`: Basic configuration of a switch
- `opdracht-01-lab1.pdf`: console session with a switch
- `opdracht-01-lab2.pdf`: simple network with 2 switches
- `opdracht-01-lab3.pdf`: simple network with a router and a switch
- `opdracht-01-lab4.pdf`: more complex network with static routing


## Acceptance criteria

1. Finish the PacketTracer task, and verify that everything is working as should. Hence "Completion = 100%".
2. Build the lab set-ups in attachment. First make a simulation of the set-up in Packet Tracer, then build them with real equipment. Write a detailed report on the work, and demonstrate the working set-up to your tutor.
3. Too often, configurations of previous groups are left behind on the equipment. In the worst case, an admin password has been installed and is blocking the device - and you can't make changes anymore. Therefore, make a checklist of procedure for your own, so you know how to reset a device to factory settings. Do this both for routers and switches.
4. Build you own cheat sheet of the bacic IOS commands. This will turn out very useful!


## Deliverables

Demo during contact moments of:

- the set-ups in PacketTracer
- the set-ups on the equipment

On Github:

- Tender
- PacketTracer files containing the simulations of the set-ups specified above
- detailed report of how you have built the test set-ups
- Test specification and report
- Checklist: how to reset your Cisco router/switch to defaults?
- Cheat sheet with IOS basic commands
