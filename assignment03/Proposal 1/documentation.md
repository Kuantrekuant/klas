### General description
This is a proposal for a Network infrastructure of an office. The office belongs to a SME Real State company of 10 employees. 
Based on the floorplan of the office we developed a proposal of both the network infrastructure and the distribution of the working space. In comparrison to the other proposal, this one focusses on the network equipment that is somewhere in the middle. It is neither the cheapest solution possible, nor is it the most expensive. However this proposal brings in our opinion cost-effective network infrastructure for a small business. This is ideal for a company that wants to invest a small amount in a long lasting network infrastructure while not having to go bankrupt by its cost.


### Technical Room
In the technical room we will have with a modem, a router and two switches. In this setup there is no extra firewall present, other than the built-in firewall of the cisco router
The internet provider company will also supply the modem. 
Because of the way we desgined our network infrastructure, there is only need for ine switch. That's because the laptops of the employees are either connected via WiFi or via the IP phone's RJ-45 port. This design ensures the possibility of future expansion as there are still plenty of available ports.
Just one router is needed to deliver connection to the office. We chose an older model that supports to keep the cost low, but still supports VoIP (Cisco 2811)
In the technical room there is also one server that will run 2 virtual machines for a file server and AD (Active Directory).

### Office
In the office there are working places for nine employees and the manager. We distributed the working spaces in such a way that there are open areas around the kitchens to potentially place some form of entertainment or for the company to provide some comfort to guests (E.x. Sofa's, tables, etc.).
The manager has his own desk and the nine employes are divided in three spaces. The desks are placed in such a way that all the cables can be neatly be organised behind the desks of the employees. All ten desks have the same equipment.
For each desk there is an IP telephone, a Laptop, an ethernet port (via the IP telephone) and an ethernet cable.
In the office we have one internet access point that should also cover the conference room. Because of the model we chose, the acces point can both be used for the employees and the guest users.

#### Technical specifications
The Laptop chosen is a HP Pavilion Power 15-cb002nb (Azerty). It has an Intel Core i7 processor with 16GB of RAM which should be enough to run all the programs that an employee needs at the same time. It also has a fairly strong graphics card (Nvidia GTX 1050) to fullfill the requirements of being able to use Adobe Creative Suite optimally. This model will allow the employees to work with comfortness while using both the office applications and the graphical tools.


The Cisco SPA 303 IP Phone is a complete telephone to make calls to the network to which the computer is connected. You can start and receive phone calls, activate active calls, use speed dial numbers, transfer calls, make conference calls, etc. In addition to the basic call management features, the phone also supports specialized or advanced phone features that allow you to expand and customize the phone call management features.

### Conference Room
The conference room designed to be used for meetings between the employees and for meetings with customers. It is equiped with a beamer and a screen, an HDMI cable, 4 ethernet ports and ethernet cable and also an IP phone. It also have wifi access, both to the network for employees and for guests.


### Cables
To connect all the devices in the office we opted for the use of CAT6 cables. A first reason for this choice is to lower the total installation cost. A second reason is that currently a CAT7 cable might be too much for the current network devices and even for the general needs of the company in the next decenia.
