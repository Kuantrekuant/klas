## PROPOSAL 2

### General description
This is a proposal for a Network infrastructure of an office. The office belongs to a SME Real State company of 10 employees. 
Based on the forplaan of the office we developed a proposal of both the network infrastrucutre and the distribution of the working space. We opted for a high quality proposal ready for expansion and future performance. Due to this considerations the chosen material is far from the cheapest offered in the market. 

### Technical Room
In the technical room we will count with a modem, a firewall, a router and two switches.
The internet provider company  will also supply the modem. 
We chose to use a firewall to improve the security of the office by keeping confidential the company imformation and keeping away any possible threat. The chosen firewall has VLAN capabilities which allows us to separate the network in different departments. 
Two switches are going to be used in order to separate the ip phone connections from the other devices connections. Having two switches ensures the possibility of future expansion as there are still plenty of available ports.
Just one router is needed to deliver connection two the office.

### Office
In the office there is working places for nine employees  and the manager. We distrubuted the working spaces regarding both the optimization of the network and the best placement for each employee.
The manager has his own desk and the nine employes are divided in three spaces for two people and one space for three people. All ten desks have the same equipment.
For each desk there is an IP telephone, a Laptop, a keyboard and a mouse, a 27'' Screen, an etehrnet port and ethernet cable, a docking station and a laptop stand.
By using the docking station and connecting the laptop by a thunderbolt cable to it, the laptop will be provided with internet, power, acces to mouse, screen and keyboard. 
In the office we count wth two internet access points. One access poitn is for employee access and the other one for guests.

### Conference Room
