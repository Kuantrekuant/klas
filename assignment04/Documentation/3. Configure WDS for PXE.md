## Configure
To start the configuration, *right click* the server in **Windows Deployment Services (WDS)** and choose **Configure Server**
In the wizard, configure the server as an Integrated server with Active Directory. Next for the **PXE Server Initial Settings** make sure you select **Respond to all client computers**. 
> This is not ideal but it just ensures that you'll be able to connect with your workstation

In the next window of the WDS Wizard you will need to **uncheck**  -*Add images to the server now*-, since we will only add boot images.

In **WDS**, *right click* Boot images and choose **Add Boot image..**, browse to your Deployment Share and go into the Boot folder, choose whatever *.wim* file you prefer *x86/x64*

Next, in **WDS**, *right click* your server and go to **Proporties**, in the **Boot tab** make sure the **Press F12** radio button is selected in both cases. Underneath those options you can set default boot images for the different architectures.

Just to make sure there are no errors, **restart your WDS**.
